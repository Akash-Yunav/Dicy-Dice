# Rules
- There are 2 players, Player 1 & Player 2, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they whish. Each result get added to their Final score when they select the "HOLD" option                    
- BUT, if the player rolls out a 1 on dice, all his GAIN score gets lost without adding to their final score. After that,the next player gets the turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his GAIN score gets added to his Final Score. and then, it's again, next player's turn 
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
- If a player gets consecutive 6 on the dice, they lose all their score, and get back to zero.
