                <strong>- There are 2 players, Player 1 & Player 2, playing in rounds <br><br>
                    - In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they whish. Each result get added to their
                    Final score when they select the "HOLD" option<br><br>
                    - BUT, if the player rolls out a 1 on dice, all his GAIN score gets lost without adding to their
                    Final score. After that,the next player
                    gets the turn
                    <br><br>
                    - The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his GAIN score gets added to his Final Score.
                    And then, it's again, next player's turn <br><br>
                    - The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game <br><br>
                    -If a player gets consecutive 6 on the dice, they lose all their score, and get back to zero.
